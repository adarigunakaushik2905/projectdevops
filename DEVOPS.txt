What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).
Its goal is to shorten the software development life cycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.
It emphasizes automation, collaboration, continuous integration (CI), and continuous delivery (CD).
DevOps Life Cycle
The DevOps life cycle is a continuous process that integrates development and operations. It is usually represented as an infinity loop (∞) showing continuous collaboration, integration, testing, delivery, deployment, monitoring, and feedback.
Here are the main phases:
1. Plan
Define project requirements and goals.
Use tools like Jira, Trello, Confluence for planning.
2. Code
Developers write code based on requirements.
Version control systems like Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket are used.
3. Build
Source code is compiled, dependencies are added, and artifacts are created.
Tools: Maven, Gradle, Jenkins, Bamboo.
4. Test
Automated tests are run to detect bugs early.
Tools: JUnit, Selenium, TestNG, PyTest.
5. Release
Code is prepared for production release.
Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Spinnaker.
6. Deploy
Code is deployed to staging/production environments automatically.
Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform.
7. Operate
Applications run smoothly in production.
Teams ensure high availability and scalability.
Tools: AWS, Azure, GCP.
8. Monitor
Monitor performance, logs, and user experience.
Tools: Nagios, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
9. Feedback (Continuous Improvement)
Feedback from monitoring is sent back to planning.
Ensures continuous improvement of the software.
Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → Feedback → (repeat)
this is the way to lifecycle of devops
